Simple example to learn about vs code extensions.

This extension adds two commands to the command palette (cmd+p):
 - "Reading Score: Flesch-Kincaid Score for Document"
 - "Reading Score: Flesch-Kincaid Score for Selection"

The commands compute a readability score using https://github.com/clearnote01/readability and display an info message with the result.

The extension also displays the score in  a status bar icon (which you can click to bring up a modal message with some more stats about the whole document)
